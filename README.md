## Overview

Welcome to the **PIXIU** project! This project is designed to support the development, fine-tuning, and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the financial domain. PIXIU is a significant step towards understanding and harnessing the power of LLMs in the financial domain.

### Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into several key components, each serving a unique purpose in the financial NLP pipeline:

- **FinBen**: Our Financial Language Understanding and Prediction Evaluation Benchmark. FinBen serves as the evaluation suite for financial LLMs, with a focus on understanding and prediction tasks across various financial contexts.
- **FIT**: Our Financial Instruction Dataset. FIT is a multi-task and multi-modal instruction dataset specifically tailored for financial tasks. It serves as the training ground for fine-tuning LLMs for these tasks.

- **FinMA**: Our Financial Large Language Model (LLM). FinMA is the core of our project, providing the learning and prediction power for our financial tasks.

### Key Features

- **Open resources**: PIXIU openly provides the financial LLM, instruction tuning data, and datasets included in the evaluation benchmark to encourage open research and transparency.
  
- **Multi-task**: The instruction tuning data and benchmark in PIXIU cover a diverse set of financial tasks, including four financial NLP tasks and one financial prediction task.
- **Multi-modality**: PIXIU's instruction tuning data and benchmark consist of multi-modality financial data, including time series data from the stock movement prediction task. It covers various types of financial texts, including reports, news articles, tweets, and regulatory filings.
- **Diversity**: Unlike previous benchmarks focusing mainly on financial NLP tasks, PIXIU's evaluation benchmark includes critical financial prediction tasks aligned with real-world scenarios, making it more challenging.

```

Please adjust run_interface.sh according to your environment requirements.

To evaluate:

```bash
python data/*/evaluate.py
```

### Create new tasks

Creating a new task for FinBen involves creating a Huggingface dataset and implementing the task in a Python file. This guide walks you through each step of setting up a new task using the FinBen framework.

#### Creating your dataset in Huggingface

Your dataset should be created in the following format:

```python
{
    "query": "...",
    "answer": "...",
    "text": "..."
}
```

In this format:

- `query`: Combination of your prompt and text
- `answer`: Your label

For **Multi-turn** tasks (such as )

For **Classification** tasks (such as [FPB (FinBen_fpb)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheFinAI/flare-fpb)), additional keys should be defined:

- `choices`: Set of labels
- `gold`: Index of the correct label in choices (Start from 0)

For **Sequential Labeling** tasks (such as [Finer Ord (FinBen_finer_ord)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheFinAI/flare-finer-ord)), additional keys should be defined:

- `label`: List of token labels

- `token`: List of tokens

For **Extractive Summarization** tasks (such as [ECTSUM (FinBen_ectsum)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheFinAI/flare-ectsum)), additional keys should be defined:

- `label`: List of sentence labels

For **abstractive Summarization** and **Question Answering** tasks (such as [EDTSUM (FinBen_edtsum)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheFinAI/flare-edtsum)), no additional keys should be defined

#### Implementing the task

Once your dataset is ready, you can start implementing your task. Your task should be defined within a new class in flare.py or any other Python file located within the tasks directory.

To cater to a range of tasks, we offer several specialized base classes, including `Classification`, `SequentialLabeling`, `RelationExtraction`, `ExtractiveSummarization`, `AbstractiveSummarization` and `QA`.

For instance, if you are embarking on a classification task, you can directly leverage our `Classification` base class. This class allows for efficient and intuitive task creation. To better demonstrate this, let's delve into an example of crafting a task named FinBen-FPB using the `Classification` base class:

```python
class flareFPB(Classification):
    DATASET_PATH = "flare-fpb"
```

And that's it! Once you've created your task class, the next step is to register it in the `src/tasks/__init__.py` file. To do this, add a new line following the format `"task_name": module.ClassName`. Here is how it's done:

```python
TASK_REGISTRY = {
    "flare_fpb": flare.FPB,
    "your_new_task": your_module.YourTask,  # This is where you add your task
}
```

#### Predefined task metrics

| Task                                     | Metric                                 | Illustration                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Classification                           | Accuracy                               | This metric represents the ratio of correctly predicted observations to total observations. It is calculated as (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Observations. |
| Classification                           | F1 Score                               | The F1 Score represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall, thereby creating an equilibrium between these two factors. It proves particularly useful in scenarios where one factor bears more significance than the other. The score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 signifying perfect precision and recall, and 0 indicating the worst case. Furthermore, we provide both 'weighted' and 'macro' versions of the F1 score. |
| Classification                           | Missing Ratio                          | This metric calculates the proportion of responses where no options from the given choices in the task are returned. |
| Classification                           | Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) | The MCC is a metric that assesses the quality of binary classifications, producing a score ranging from -1 to +1. A score of +1 signifies perfect prediction, 0 denotes a prediction no better than random chance, and -1 indicates a completely inverse prediction. |
| Sequential Labeling                      | F1 score                               | In the context of Sequential Labeling tasks, we utilize the F1 Score as computed by the `seqeval` library, a robust entity-level evaluation metric. This metric mandates an exact match of both the entity's span and type between the predicted and ground truth entities for a correct evaluation. True Positives (TP) represent correctly predicted entities, False Positives (FP) denote incorrectly predicted entities or entities with mismatched spans/types, and False Negatives (FN) signify missed entities from the ground truth. Precision, recall, and F1-score are then computed using these quantities, with the F1 Score representing the harmonic mean of precision and recall. |
| Sequential Labeling                      | Label F1 score                         | This metric evaluates model performance based solely on the correctness of the labels predicted, without considering entity spans. |
| Relation Extraction                      | Precision                              | Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted relations out of all predicted relations. It is calculated as the number of True Positives (TP) divided by the sum of True Positives and False Positives (FP). |
| Relation Extraction                      | Recall                                 | Recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted relations out of all actual relations. It is calculated as the number of True Positives (TP) divided by the sum of True Positives and False Negatives (FN). |
| Relation Extraction                      | F1 score                               | The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balance between these two metrics. The F1 Score is at its best at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0. |
| Extractive and Abstractive Summarization | Rouge-N                                | This measures the overlap of N-grams (a contiguous sequence of N items from a given sample of text) between the system-generated summary and the reference summary. 'N' can be 1, 2, or more, with ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 being commonly used to assess unigram and bigram overlaps respectively. |
| Extractive and Abstractive Summarization | Rouge-L                                | This metric evaluates the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the system and the reference summaries. LCS takes into account sentence level structure similarity naturally and identifies longest co-occurring in-sequence n-grams automatically. |
| Question Answering                       | EmACC                                  | EMACC assesses the exact match between the model-generated response and the reference answer. In other words, the model-generated response is considered correct only if it matches the reference answer exactly, word-for-word. |

>  Additionally, you can determine if the labels should be lowercased during the matching process by specifying `LOWER_CASE` in your class definition. This is pertinent since labels are matched based on their appearance in the generated output. For tasks like examinations where the labels are a specific set of capitalized letters such as 'A', 'B', 'C', this should typically be set to False.

### Generating Datasets for FIT

When you are working with the Financial Instruction Dataset (FIT), it's crucial to follow the prescribed format for training and testing models.

The format should look like this:

```json
{
    "id": "unique id",
    "conversations": [
        {
            "from": "human",
            "value": "Your prompt and text"
        },
        {
            "from": "agent",
            "value": "Your answer"
        }
    ],
    "text": "Text to be classified",
    "label": "Your label"
}
```

Here's what each field means:

- "id": a unique identifier for each example in your dataset.
- "conversations": a list of conversation turns. Each turn is represented as a dictionary, with "from" representing the speaker, and "value" representing the text spoken in the turn.
- "text": the text to be classified.
- "label": the ground truth label for the text.


The first turn in the "conversations" list should always be from "human", and contain your prompt and the text. The second turn should be from "agent", and contain your answer.

## FinMA v0.1: Financial Large Language Model

We are pleased to introduce the first version of FinMA, including three models FinMA-7B, FinMA-7B-full, FinMA-30B, fine-tuned on LLaMA 7B and LLaMA-30B. FinMA-7B and FinMA-30B are trained with the NLP instruction data, while FinMA-7B-full is trained with the full instruction data from FIT covering both NLP and prediction tasks. 

FinMA v0.1 is now available on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/TheFinAI/finma-7b-nlp) for public use. We look forward to the valuable contributions that this initial version will make to the financial NLP field and encourage users to apply it to various financial tasks and scenarios. We also invite feedback and shared experiences to help improve future versions.

### How to fine-tune a new large language model using PIXIU based on FIT?

Coming soon.

## FinMem: A Performance-Enhanced LLM Trading Agent

FinMem is a novel LLM-based agent framework devised for financial decision-making, encompasses three core modules: Profiling, to outline the agent's characteristics; Memory, with layered processing, to aid the agent in assimilating realistic hierarchical financial data; and Decision-making, to convert insights gained from memories into investment decisions. Currently, FinMem can trade single stocks with high returns after a simple mode warm-up. Below is a quick start for a dockerized version framework, with TSLA as sample input.

Step 1: Set environmental variables
in `.env` add HUGGINGFACE TOKEN and OPENAI API KEY as needed.
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY = "<Your OpenAI Key>"
HF_TOKEN = "<Your HF token>"
```

Step 2: Set endpoint URL in `config.toml`
Use endpoint URL to deploy models based on the model of choice (OPENAI, Gemini, open source models on HuggingFace, etc.). For open-source models on HuggingFace, one choice for generating TGI endpoints is through RunPod. 
```bash
[chat]
model = "tgi"
end_point = "<set the your endpoint address>"
tokenization_model_name = "<model name>"
...
```

Step 3: Build Docker Image and Container
```bash
docker build -t test-finmem .devcontainer/. 
```
start container:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/finmem test-finmem bash
```

Step 4: Start Simulation!
```bash
 Usage: run.py sim [OPTIONS]
